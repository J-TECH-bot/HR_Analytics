# Conclution
 We have to divide the projects equally because giving high number of projects to a single person increase work load and they decide to leave the company.
 Not low number of projects also because it give them less oppertunity to increase the work experience.
 Those who spent more time in a company will stay but those who are not able to acccomadate with the company policies they leave.
 Those who have high salary they are not leaving the company.
 Promote the experienced people. On the basis of some performence evaluation test.

# Future aspects
# Apply AI and ML and create full fledged n to n project.
